# R functions for data processing and data analysis
This repository includes a set of R functions for self-report, physiological, and behavioural data management and data analysis, and especially for dealing with multilevel data.

## R functions

### Descriptives

### Psychometrics

### Multilevel modeling

- `glmerAn` fits generalized linear (mixed-effects) regression (GLM/GLMER) models and prints the core numeric and graphical ouputs considered for the analyses.

- `key.resPlot` visualizes the key results (Akaike weight, likelihood ratio test, and *t* value) obtained with the `glmerAn` function.

## R packages

The functions are based on the following R packages:

- `lme4`

- `ggplot2`

- `sjPlot`
